# Client-supplied Encryption Key

Encryption algorithms supported: `aegis-256`, `aes-256-gcm`.

At the basin level, users configure the encryption algorithm (or none, the default) to apply to newly created streams in that basin.

New streams record this algorithm in their metadata when created. It is immutable for the lifetime of a stream and cannot be reconfigured.

Data plane `append` and `read` operations look for the `s2-encryption-key` header, where it must be provided as a base64 string if encryption is enabled.

Data plane operations treat the `s2-encryption-key` header as opaque base64-encoded key material. If we need wrapped or structured key material in future, that may be introduced as a format discriminator.

The encryption key should stay consistent for a given stream, but this is not enforced by the service.
- If no key is provided when required, the `append` or `read` operation will fail.
- The same key used to encrypt when appending must be used when reading records.
- Appends will succeed even if a different key is provided than previously used.

Encryption algorithm is one of the pieces of stream-level metadata returned when listing streams.
